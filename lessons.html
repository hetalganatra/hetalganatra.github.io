    <h2>Teen Course...</h2>
    <p>Students between the ages of 14 years 9 months and 24 years of age are required to complete the teen course in order <br> to obtain their license. The state requires 32 hours of classroom instruction followed by 14 hours of behind-the-wheel instruction.<br> During the first week of class at our school, we will administer the written exam. Upon passing, the student will receive <br> a certificate that allows him or her to trade it in for a permit at the DPS. After obtaining their permit, the student is still <br> required to complete the remaining hours of class, however they may also begin to schedule their driving lessons outside <br> of the class time. Once completing all of the classroom and behind-the-wheel instructional hours, the student will then <br> receive a second certificate, allowing the student to obtain his or her license. In order to obtain a license, the student <br> must be at least 16 years of age and have held their permit for a minimum of 6 months.</p>
